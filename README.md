This script demonstrates how to swap the values of two variables in Ruby. It covers different methods for swapping values, including using a temporary variable and using parallel assignment.

### 12. assignment_shortcuts.rb
This script covers various assignment shortcuts available in Ruby. It explains how to use shorthand operators for arithmetic and logical operations, such as `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, and more.

### 13. constants.rb
This script introduces constants in Ruby. It explains how to define and use constants, the naming conventions, and the differences between constants and variables. The script also discusses the scope and reassignment of constants.

### 14. begin_rescue_ensure.rb
This script provides a detailed look at error handling in Ruby using `begin`, `rescue`, and `ensure` blocks. It demonstrates how to catch and handle exceptions, ensure that certain code always runs, and manage

### 15. objects.rb
This script introduces the concept of objects in Ruby. It explains how to create and use objects, covering the basics of classes, instance variables, and methods. The script also demonstrates how to instantiate objects and interact with their properties and behaviors.

### 16. exceptions.rb
This script introduces exception handling in the context of object-oriented programming (OOP) in Ruby. It shows how to define custom exception classes, raise exceptions within methods, and handle them using `begin`, `rescue`, and `ensure` blocks. The script emphasizes the integration of exception handling with OOP principles.

### 17. method_chaining.rb
This script delves into the concept of method chaining in Ruby. It explains how to create and use chained methods to streamline code and improve readability. The script covers the basics of returning `self` from methods, allowing multiple method calls on the same object in a single statement. Additionally, it demonstrates practical examples of method chaining and its benefits in simplifying complex operations.

### 18. inspect_method.rb
This script introduces the `inspect` method in Ruby, which provides a string representation of an object for debugging purposes. It explains how the `inspect` method can be used to gain insights

### 19. nil_method.rb
This script explores the `nil?` method in Ruby, which checks if an object is `nil`. It explains how to use the `nil?` method to determine whether a variable or an object holds a `nil` value, a common scenario in Ruby programming. The script also covers the significance of `nil` in Ruby, how it differs from other falsy values, and the importance of handling `nil` values appropriately to avoid runtime errors. Practical examples demonstrate the usage of `nil?` in various contexts, highlighting its role in ensuring robust and error-free code.

### 20. string_interpolation.rb
This script introduces the concept of string interpolation in Ruby, a powerful feature that allows embedding expressions within string literals. It explains how to use the `#{}` syntax to insert the value of any Ruby expression into a string. The script covers various use cases of string interpolation, including embedding variables, method

### 20. gets_method.rb
This script explores the `gets` method in Ruby, which is used to read input from the standard input (usually the keyboard). It explains how to use the `gets` method to capture user input and how to handle the input data. The script covers basic usage of `gets`, including how to prompt the user for input and store the entered value in a variable. It also discusses common pitfalls, such as the inclusion of newline characters, and demonstrates how to strip these characters for cleaner input handling. Practical examples show the `gets` method in action, highlighting its role in interactive Ruby programs.

### 21. class_method.rb
This script delves into class methods in Ruby, which are methods defined on the class itself rather than on instances of the class. It explains how to create and use class methods using the `self` keyword or by defining methods directly on the class. The script covers the differences between class methods and instance methods, highlighting scenarios where class methods are particularly useful.

### 22. converting_object_type.rb
This script covers the concept of object type conversion in Ruby. It explains how to convert objects from one type to another using various built-in methods such as `to_s`, `to_i`, `to_f`, and `to_a`. The script discusses the importance of type conversion in ensuring data compatibility and correctness in Ruby programs.

## Getting Started

To run these scripts, you'll need to have Ruby installed on your machine. If you haven't installed Ruby yet, you can download it from [ruby-lang.org](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/).

### Running a Script

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where you've saved the script.
3. Run the script using the `ruby` command followed by the script's filename. For example:
   ```sh
   ruby hello_world.rb
